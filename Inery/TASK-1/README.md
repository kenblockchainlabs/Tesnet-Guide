IP Address use your server IP.
Account Name use any name you want (max 12 char).
Password use a secure password and don't lose it :)
After registering you'll see secret phrase backup, make sure you're back up your phrase!

If you're deploying Master Nodes, make sure to claim 50.000 INR Test Token From Faucet. For Lite Nodes it's no need to claim the token.
